To the extent that there is any third-party software embedded in, bundled with, or otherwise provided to Customer in connection with the Licensed Software (“Third Party Software”), such Third Party Software shall be used solely with the operation of the Licensed Software and not as a standalone application or for any other purpose. Certain Third Party Software may be subject to an open source license (“OSS License”). Customer’s rights with respect to such components are governed by the applicable OSS License; nothing in this Agreement shall restrict, limit, or otherwise affect any rights or obligations Customer may have under such OSS License.

All pre-existing intellectual property remains the property of the originating party; no intellectual property is transferred from Customer to Supplier under this Agreement.

4.5 Restrictions.

5. Licensing and Use Rights

5.1 Personal Use via GitHub Sponsorship. Personal use is permitted through an active GitHub Sponsorship to either @alexellis or @openfaas on GitHub at a minimum of 25 USD per month. Termination, lapse, or downgrade of Sponsorship below this minimum immediately terminates the license. Personal use counts only for installation to privately owned hardware, or rented cloud hosts, which are in no way connected to or operated for or on the behalf of a business. Personal licenses are for a single named individual, non-transferable, and may not be used to provide services to, or on behalf of, any business, organization, or client.

5.2 Commercial Use. Commercial use requires a paid license per user (seat). A minimum of five (5) seats is required and licenses are paid annually via ACH in USD or SWIFT in GBP. To request a commercial license, email [contact@openfaas.com](mailto:contact@openfaas.com). Contractors, consultants, managed service providers, and any use on infrastructure connected to or operated for or on behalf of a business require a commercial license.

5.3 Priority of Terms. If there is any conflict between this Section 5 and any Order Form, the Order Form shall prevail solely with respect to the quantities, term, and pricing stated therein.

6. Termination and Continuing Obligations; Renewal Responsibility

6.1 Term. This Agreement is effective from the first date you install, access, or use the Licensed Software and continues until terminated as set forth below.

6.2 By Customer. Customer may terminate this Agreement at any time by permanently deleting the Licensed Software, destroying all copies, and ceasing all use.

6.4 Automatic Termination. This Agreement terminates automatically without notice upon expiry of the license term, failure to renew, or termination of the qualifying GitHub Sponsorship for personal use.

6.5 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, Customer must immediately stop using the Licensed Software, delete all copies in its possession or control, and confirm in writing to Supplier that these actions have been completed. Sections 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 survive termination.

6.6 Renewal Responsibility. It is the sole responsibility of Customer to renew and remit payment for any licenses in a timely manner to maintain uninterrupted access and compliance. Supplier recommends requesting a renewal quote at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiry of the current term. Supplier bears no costs, liabilities, or obligations related to Customer’s failure to renew or remit payment; any interruption due to non-renewal or non-payment does not entitle Customer to any remedies or compensation.
